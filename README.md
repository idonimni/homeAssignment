- The old API was not given, so I've mocked it- returned the exact XML string response from the instructions (the example).

- The instructions didn't state which action method to use (get or post), but I decided to use POST for type flexibility and data protection (The data is neither cached nor appears in the browsing history).

- I attached the POSTMAN collection I've used to test the web API.
